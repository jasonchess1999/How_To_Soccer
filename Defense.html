                        <p>The team that does not have possession of the ball is the defense. Good team defense is essential to winning any soccer game. Defense is not just the goalie's job, but the job off all eleven players. 

A good defensive soccer team will learn to communicate and form walls of defense against the offense. A player or two should always remain between the ball and the goal. Other players should be covering the other offensive players to make sure that they can't get open for a short goal shot. This is often called "marking". 

It is a good idea for defenders to force the player with the ball towards the sidelines. By playing the right angle and turning the body, the defensive player can guide or channel the offensive player to the sidelines. This makes it hard for the offense to get off a good shot or get a good angle for a pass. It can also cause them to lose the soccer ball over the sideline and, therefore, get the possession back.

Some teams have a player they call the sweeper. This is a defensive player that positions in the center of the soccer field usually a bit deeper than the rest of the defense. The sweeper roams the backfield looking to steal or "sweep" any balls that get through the defense. 

Defenses can also trap the player with the ball with two players preventing them from getting off a pass and stealing the ball. This can be a risky but rewarding play. 

Defenses should take advantage of the soccer offside rule. By coordinating the last line of defense and keeping track of the offensive player's locations, a defense can trap a player offsides and cause a turnover of the ball.</p>
