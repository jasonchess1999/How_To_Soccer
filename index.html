                        <p>The game is played by two opposing teams, with eleven members each team including the goalkeeper. It is played on a rectangular field with the main goal of driving the ball into the opponents goal to achieve a score. The ball is primarily played with the feet and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch and handle the ball. The main reason why this sport has gained its popularity is because it is one of the most accessible and adaptable amongst all other sports.</p>
